### Personal feedback on this course:
This course (CS50) has been quite popular due to **Prof. David J. Malanâ€™s** lucid explanation and creative ways of teaching the concepts of Computer Science, thus making it easier for beginners to grasp the contents quite easily.
I recommend every CS aspirant to take up this course!
